=========== AIRBUS PLANNING PROBLEM SIMULATOR ===========

The simulator takes three arguments
	execution plan generated by LAMA
	problem definition file (pddl)
	speed (ms)

Example:
	java -jar Airbus.jar plans/p01-plan problems/airbus-seats-p01-6f-6p.pddl 500

Some considerations:
	The problems must be defined using as object names:
		row1 row2 row3 ... for rows
		pass1 pass2 pass3 ... for passengers
	Everything must be enumerated ascending.

Note: The execution plans generated by MpC my be modified a little in order to be accepted by the simulator.
